# Age of Empires-style taunt messages support for IRSSI.

Spams you with pleasant noise when people spam loving messages such as 14 over and over.

## Setup

* Setup a taunts folder in a location of your choosing (accessible by IRSSI). Files should be formatted in the same fashion as Age of Empires': number followed by a space followed by the remainder of the file name, for instance "02 No.mp3".
* Install the taunts script.
* Set the taunts_dir setting to the proper location.
